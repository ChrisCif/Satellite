Satellite is a classic space shooter game in which the player controls a satellite that orbits around the Earth and defends thew planet from an alien invasion.

Satellite was the first game I developed in Microsoft's XNA framework. That said it is writen entirely in C# and through Microsoft's Game Studio in the Visual Studio IDE. The game went through four moths of development (February - May) and had only one release. However, the game did go through two separate drafts with the first having never been finished.
